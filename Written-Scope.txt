Scope

Problem 1


Problem 2


Problem 3
A: It is not true. Taking the oldest value of x in the environment in the following counter-example would yield an incorrect result.

(let ([x 3])
  (let ([x 4])
    (let ([f (lambda (y) (+ x y))])
      (let ([x 5])
        (f 10)))))

env = [(x 5) (x 4) (x 3)]


Problem 4
A: The with operator in JS violates static scope.


Problem 5
A: The closure only need to close over the bindings in the environment that are the free variables of the lambda.
